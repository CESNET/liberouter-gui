# Liberouter GUI

Liberouter GUI provides unified interface to a couple of services developed in CESNET. Namely:
* NEMEA Dashboard
* SecurityCloud
* NERD
* FTAS

Liberouter GUI encapsulates all modules visually and logically. On the backend it takes care of user, session and configuration management and authorization.

Frontend utilizes Angular 4 to create modular frontend environment.
